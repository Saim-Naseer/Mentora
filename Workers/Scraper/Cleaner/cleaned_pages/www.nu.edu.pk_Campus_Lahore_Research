## Multi-Media Lab (MML)

This lab is developing innovate techniques for efficient communication of voice, video and data, especially in the internet connected world. Limited bandwidth of transmission medium (wire-line and wireless) and user’s demand for good quality of service pose interesting challenges for the researchers.

Specific areas of work in Computer Networks include providing QoS in the WLANs for real-time multimedia communication, Statistical modelling of the MAC layer for delay and throughput analysis, cross-layer design for improving performance over wireless networks, and joint source-channel encoding for image and video. In wireless communication, the research focuses on exploiting MIMO technology in order to develop algorithms to achieve higher data rates at low errors. This includes analysing system performance under various channel conditions and designing coding schemes to mitigate the effects of channel impairment.

One of the projects, entitled, “Dynamic Scheduling and Call Admission Control for Quality of Service (QoS) Provision in Real-time Multimedia Application over IEEE 802.11e Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)” was funded by the PTCL R&D Fund for Thematic Research Grant. The goal of this research was to develop novel scheduling and call admission control (CAC) mechanisms for IEEE 802.11e WLANs. Outcome of this research was development of a novel scheduler, named Proportional Increase and Multiplicative Decrease (PIMD), and a measurement based CAC algorithms. Both algorithms have been published in the proceedings of International refereed conferences. As an extension to this project, modelling and delay analysis of real time multimedia streams (voice and video) over WLAN is being done with an aim to achieve optimal admission control that adapts to dynamic network conditions. Mathematical analysis of PIMD for its suability in various network configurations is being investigated.

In MIMO wireless communication systems, analytical modelling under various fading channels and employing hybrid system (BLAST vs. STBC) are current areas of research. Work is also being done on enhancing combating capabilities of system against variations and inherent interference present in fading. The MIMO systems are being analysed by including pre-coder and multi-user detection. The future direction of the research is towards developing communication and network algorithms for implementation for the upcoming 4G –LTE and mobile wi-max systems.

## Centre for Research on Management and Governance (CRMG)

## Liberty Lab for Robotics

Liberty Lab is established to engineer multi-disciplinary solutions for socially grounded problems and to achieve advancement in Robotics. Research is done to make robots that can achieve autonomous behavior. Problems of localization, mapping, navigation and image processing in robots are explored. Control algorithms on ground and air robots are developed to improve the navigation capabilities of such robots. The goal is to make autonomous mobile and industrial robots, and induce learning and long-term autonomy in them. Using the output of this research, solutions to industrial and societal problems using robotics and embedded systems technology are devised. The lab aims to construct low cost robots that are intelligent enough to work around in industry, farms and houses. A lot of algorithms have been devised in literature with promising results, but still we don’t see these algorithms deployed on robots around us. The research group thus wants to make robots for very simple tasks which can be performed by robots.

Similarly, there are scenarios that only require an embedded solution, as opposed to standard articulated robot. The research group aims to devise such embedded systems. The lab has expanded its operation in three broad thematic areas namely, systems, humans and crops. The lab aims to put together and apply the knowledge gained from diverse areas of expertise including robotics, embedded systems and artificial intelligence, to engineer out-of-the-box solutions that practically solve the problems faced by the local society. The lab achieves its aims via workshops, talks and projects at both graduate and undergraduate levels.

**Collaborators and Research Partners**

The lab initiated multiple projects in collaboration with leading medical institutes of the country, including, King Edward Medical University and Services Institute of Medical Sciences (Services Hospital). These projects include an EMG controlled prosthetic arm, retinopathy classification for diabetics, bio-thesiometer for neuropathy, contact-less waist measurement for patients and bone recovery analyzer.

The research group has acquired a grant from the German government in collaboration with University of Kaiserslautern, for a medium term project to start automation of agriculture in Pakistan using robots. Students and faculty members from both participating universities will visit and work with their partner university for a couple of months each year. The grant will be utilized for R&D in automatic detection of weed in wheat crops using flying robots.

The research group organized the 7th International Workshop on Field and Assistive Robots (WFAR-7) on 17-18 Oct 2014, which showcased talks from researchers, robot demos and poster session with robotics students. It brought together the robotics community in Pakistan and Europe. This year, the group plans to organize the 9th International event on Field and Assistive Robots in October 2015.

**Current Projects**

The lab currently consists of three faculty members, five research assistants, nine graduate students and about 50 undergrad students. Projects currently underway are disaster management using robotics, collaborative tasks using teams of robots, aid of shoppers, etc. The lab is also running multiple projects on traffic congestion detection and control using different sensing mechanisms including mobile phone accelerometers, cameras, flying robots and crowd sourcing. In the field of agriculture, the lab runs projects to monitor weed, pests and irrigation of crops.
