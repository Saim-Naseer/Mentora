**[www.linkedin.com/groups/Center-Research-in-Ubiquitous-Computing-4452137/about](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Center-Research-in-Ubiquitous-Computing-4452137/about)**

Ubiquitous Computing (computing everywhere for everyone) promotes the idea of integrating computation into the environment, rather than having computers in daily life. The idea will enable people and machines to move around and interact with information and computing in informal way, to sense changes in their environment and to automatically adapt and act based on these changes

CRUC was established in March 2006 and has several faculty and student members including 10 Ph.D. fellows working on diverse projects and ideas within this domain. More than 40 research papers are published in International conferences and Journals by the Centre in last 2 years. The Centre has active collaboration with researchers and faculty members of universities of Australia, China, USA, UK and UAE. The Centre has funding by Microsoft and support from European Union, ICT R&D and HEC.

The CRUC has also offered several Doctoral and Graduate level courses to equip students with latest challenges of computer science. It is regularly arranging seminars and workshops on different areas where researchers present their ideas. At least one research conference is arranged at each year where graduating students present their findings.

Under the umbrella of Ubiquitous Computing, we are working in the areas of Augmented and Virtual Reality, Human Computer Interaction, Multi Agent Systems, Grid and Cloud Computing, Robotics & Sensor Networks, Workflow Systems, Provenance Systems and Agri Informatics.

## The Machine Intelligence Group

The group focuses on multiple aspects related to machine learning, computer vision, data and text mining, and information retrieval.

Computer Vision focuses on giving machines the ability to understand visual input. The ability to automatically extract information from visual input finds its applications in video surveillance at airports, streets, banks, old homes, schools, in medical imaging to assist in diagnosis and surgeries, in human computer interaction (playing games, controlling computers with gestures, etc), in exploration of outer-space, and other areas of scientific research. Machine Learning provides exciting aspects for enhancement and automation.

The group also focuses on knowledge discovery from textual data. It is involved in extracting unstructured text, processing of information, converting into structural form for meta representation, associating semantics information, and performing innovative task specific processing.
 Some of the ongoing projects of the group include video surveillance, object classification and search, action activity recognition, and the analysis of crowded scenes. On the information retrieval side, the group is currently focused on Document clustering, Text summarization, Sentiment analysis, Named entity/event information mining, and web search and ranking. The algorithms and techniques proposed during last five years from the group received excellent citation from the research community.
