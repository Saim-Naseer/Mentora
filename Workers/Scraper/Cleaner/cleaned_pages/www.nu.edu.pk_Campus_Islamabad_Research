## Management Advancement Research Center - MARC

The Management Advancement Research Centre
 (MARC) was established at FAST_NUCES
 Islamabad to conduct leading edge research in
 management sciences with the aim to enhance
 knowledge and find solutions for industry challenges.
 Various Special Interest Groups (SIGs) work under
 MARC, all committed to taking up projects which
 contribute to the body of knowledge, yet at the same
 time provide a bridge between academia and practice.
 The Leadership and Management SIG has carried out
 various projects on leadership, cross-cultural HRM
 and performance management over the past few
 years. International projects and partnerships include
 work with the Cross-Cultural Management Network
 (CCMN) under which the main past project covered
 trust and leadership across cultures, while the current
 project is based on leadership behaviours, trust and
 job embeddedness across cultures covering data from
 25 countries. Another landmark project of the SIG
 includes collection of data on the GLOBE 2020
 project for comparison of cultural dimension in
 Pakistan with 100 plus countries in collaboration with
 Simon Frasier University, Canada; the Director
 MARC also conducted the GLOBE study in Pakistan
 in the past. The lead researcher has also been
 involved in various projects on performance
 management to improve industry practices, and has a
 special interest in using data to improve HR
 practices.

The Project Management and the Organizational
 Behaviour SIGs expand the scope of MARC. The
 team's expertise include behavioural decision making
 in project management, justice, creativity,
 organizational politics, workplace stressors and
 psychological stressors. The SIG researchers have
 various publications in the above mentioned areas
 and are interested in working with industry to
 improve organizational practices.

#### Vision and Mission of MARC

- **Vision:** Aspiring to impact management theory and
 practice through creative and ethical research.  
- **Mission:** To conduct high quality research, following
 highest standards of ethics, to provide useful
 solutions for management, businesses and society,
 keeping a balance between points of convergence and
 divergence in an increasingly global business world.

#### Research Values of MARC

- **Creativity:** Using imaginative and original ideas to
 create something new.  
- **Excellence:** Embracing high standards and
 continuously creating better ways of doing things.  
- **Impact:** : Improving understanding of complex
 business issues, to impact human and institutional
 functioning.

#### The MARC Team

- The MARC team is led by the Director MARC, Dr.
 Sadia Nadeem and Deputy Directors Dr. Muhammad
 Abbas and Dr. Shuja ul Islam. The core team also
 includes Dr. Abdul Wahab and Ms. Ayesha Bano.

## Software Quality Engineering and Testing (QUEST) Center

The Software Quality Engineering and Testing Center (QUEST) focuses on engineering of reliable and dependable software systems. Quality Engineering and Testing of software systems is an active research area and is receiving a lot of attention worldwide. However, catastrophic software failures are still reported frequently. There is an ever-increasing need to develop better quality software by using systematic engineering techniques. For this purpose, the center will investigate the use of model-driven approaches for developing high quality software.

Almost all professionals in software industry agree on the need to thoroughly test the developed software. However, the actual testing process is severely hindered by lack of automation. Software testing is a time consuming process that requires specific expertise and automation to be cost-effective, which are often not available in industry.

The QUEST center aims to bridge this gap by developing novel strategies and tools for quality engineering and automated testing that are scalable in industrial context. The real impact of software engineering is visible only when the practices/techniques are transferred to the practitioners/industry. Therefore, the center focuses on performing applied research by solving real industrial problems. For this purpose we work closely with local and international industrial and research partners. The key research and academic goals of the lab include:

- To propose and evaluate new methodologies for engineering quality software systems.
- To develop new and innovative testing strategies for cost effective testing.
- To improve the quality engineering practices of local organizations by providing automated quality engineering tools and techniques.
- To conduct high quality research in collaboration with international research organizations.
- To allow students and researchers in Pakistan to work with top international research institutes and researchers in the field of quality engineering.

**International Collaborations**

Engineering dependable and reliable systems is a difficult challenge, which requires cross-disciplinary collaboration involving both the academia and the industry. The Quest lab is actively involved in research collaborations with researchers from renowned research organizations such as Simula Labs, Norway and the Inter-disciplinary Center for Security and Trust (SnT).

**Current Projects**

- Integrated Toolset for automated model-based testing – MBT-Toolset (National ICT R&D Funded) Collaboration: Simula Labs, Norway.
- Automated model based constraint solver. Collaboration: SnT, Luxumbourg
- Automated Re-factoring of UML Models. Collaboration: Cisco Systems Inc.
- Automated testing of model transformations
- Model based development of dependable mobile applications

## Software Engineering Research Center (SERC)

The objectives of this centre are to carry out research and development in software engineering and allied application areas. The centre promotes theoretical research in the software engineering area, resolve problems faced by the software industry, and helps establish software engineering practices in the industry. Through SERC, the University seeks to help and support the local software industry in establishing and improving their processes and practices through continuous feedback and training. SERC aims to achieve these objectives by collecting the industry data to understand productivity, cost, and quality parameters. This will hopefully also help in developing more suitable process and lifecycle models for different types of projects being undertaken by our local industry in the offshore and distributed environment. Software Architecture, Software Project Management, Software Quality and Process Improvement are main areas of research.

**Sample Projects Completed**

- Software Maintenance Prediction: An Architecture Perspective.
- Coverage Analysis for GUI Testing.
- Intelligent Requirement Prioritization using Fuzzy Logic.
- Proposing Architecture for Grid Monitoring Tools.
- Tracing Architecture Decisions to Requirements.

## HALP (Huawei Authorized Learning Partner)

To bridge the gap between academia and industry, the University has joined hands with Huawei Technologies to establish a training center at its Islamabad campus. It is now a “Huawei Authorized Learning Partner (HALP)” and is able to deliver Huawei Certified Network Associate training program. The three programs currently offered include HCNA Unified Communications and HCNA Storage and HCNA Routers and Switches. Six batches that constituted Industry Professionals and University Alumni have successfully completed HCNA training from HALP.

## HAINA (Huawei Authorized Information and Network Academy)

Huawei Authorized Information and Network Academy (HAINA) is a not-for-profit partnership program that authorizes universities and colleges to deliver Huawei Certification courses to their students. Huawei and Islamabad campus signed HAINA agreement recently and two batches have already completed their Training Program. The University believes that practical knowledge will create opportunities and will support effective and sustainable growth. Through the HAINA program, Huawei and NUCES contributes support to the local ICT education, shares knowledge, creates more opportunities, and builds a better ICT talent eco-system.
