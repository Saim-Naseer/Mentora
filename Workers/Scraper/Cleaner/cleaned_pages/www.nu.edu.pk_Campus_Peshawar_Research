## Decision Support Systems Group

**Objectives:**

Intelligent decision making is important in area for building computerized decision support systems. The research goals of this group are directed toward understanding and building intelligent decision making models for assisting and supporting decision making in different application areas such as image processing, security and bioinformatics. The fundamental issues that are generally encountered in such models are too many options to choose from and involvement of contradictory decision making criteria. The group is actively engaged in utilizing machine learning methods, such as rough sets and granular computing, in inducing rules for complex decision making. One of the main focus area is three-way decision making, especially when multi-criteria and multi-agents are involved.

**Key Projects:**

- Development of effective classification technique for malware analysis
- A three-way decision making approach to protein function classification
- Employing game theory in building effective recommender system

## Center for Research in High Performance Reconfigurable Computing

Reconfigurable computing, a computer architecture which provides flexibility through features such as field-programmable hardware, is emerging as a promising paradigm of high-performance information processing. We aim to establish the nation's first multidisciplinary research center in reconfigurable high-performance computing, and to support industry and government needs with cooperative, cost-effective research programs and rapid technology transfer. Reconfigurable systems can work for a variety of platforms, from large-scale machines on earth to mission-critical machines in space. Advantages can be realized in performance, power, size, cooling, cost, versatility, scalability, and dependability.

**Program Objectives**

The MS (Computer Science) comprises course work and research component. It has four ‘core courses’ aimed at strengthening the understanding and competence in computer science fundamentals. The University expects its MS graduates to pursue careers either as ‘Computer Science Faculty Members’ or as ‘Software Development Managers’ in the industry.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Students will be able to possess advanced knowledge of Computer Science field
- Students will be able to think creatively and critically; to solve non-trivial problems
- Students will be able to use computing knowledge to develop efficient solutions for real life problems
- Students will be able to design solutions and can conduct research related activities
**Recommended Courses**

The following core courses are recommended to be completed before entering the MS (CS) program.

1. Computer Programming
2. Data Structures
3. Operating Systems
4. Database Systems
5. Analysis of Algorithms
6. Computer Networks
7. Theory of Automata
8. Software Engineering
9. Assembly Lang. / Computer Arch.


A student selected for admission having deficiency in the above stated courses may be required to study a maximum of FOUR courses. These courses must be passed in the first two semesters. The deficiency courses shall be determined by the Graduate Studies Committee before admitting the student.**No fee will be charged for studying deficiency courses.**A student cannot take MS courses unless all specified deficiency courses have been passed. Typical course load in a semester is four courses. However, NUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester.A student has the option to pursue MS by undertaking either a 6 credit hour MS Thesis or MS Project, spread over two regular semesters.

**Award of Degree**

For the award of MS degree, a student must have:

- Passed courses totalling at least 31 credit hours, including all those courses which have been specified as Core courses
- Obtained a CGPA of at least 2.5
